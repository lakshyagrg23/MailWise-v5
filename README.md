# MailWise: AI-Powered Email Management System

Managing an inbox can be overwhelming, with important emails often getting buried under less
relevant ones. MailWise helps users easily find critical emails by categorizing them intelligently.
Unlike basic spam filtering, it ensures that essential emails—whether urgent or potentially useful
later—are easy to locate. Additionally, users can personalize and specify categorization rules based
on what is important to them and the type of emails they receive, making the system highly
adaptable to individual needs.

<br>

MailWise is a complete email management platform designed to make accessing and organizing emails easier and more efficient. By using the **Gmail API**, MailWise securely fetches emails from the user's Gmail account after authentication via **Google OAuth**. It then categorizes these emails into major predefined categories such as Essential, Finance, and Updates, while also allowing users to create **personalized categories** for their specific needs, with **AI** handling segregation of received emails according to the personalization provided by the user.

In addition to organizing emails, MailWise enhances the **email composition** experience by providing **AI-assisted email writing**, making sending emails faster and more efficient. The system **optimizes** the **entire email workflow**, ensuring that users can easily manage and interact with their inbox.
